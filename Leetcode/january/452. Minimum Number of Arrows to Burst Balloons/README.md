<h3>Medium</h3>
<hr>
<div><p>
There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>  points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
</pre>
<pre>
Explanation:The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].
  </pre>
  


Constraints:
<pre>
1 <= points.length <= 105
points[i].length == 2
-231 <= xstart < xend <= 231 - 1
