<h3>Medium</h3>

<div><p>
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

-1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
Return the number that I picked.

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>    n = 10, pick = 6
<strong>Output:</strong> 6
</pre>

Example 2:

Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
 

Constraints:
<pre>
1 <= n <= 231 - 1
1 <= pick <= n
