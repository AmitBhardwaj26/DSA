<h3>Medium</h3>
<hr>
<div><p>
On a 2D plane, we place n stones at some integer coordinate points. Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.

A stone can be removed if it shares either the same row or the same column as another stone that has not been removed.

Given an array stones of length n where stones[i] = [xi, yi] represents the location of the ith stone, return the largest possible number of stones that can be removed.
</p>


<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>    stones = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 5
</pre>
<pre>
One way to remove 5 stones is as follows:
1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,1].
2. Remove stone [2,1] because it shares the same column as [0,1].
3. Remove stone [1,2] because it shares the same row as [1,0].
4. Remove stone [1,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].
5. Remove stone [0,1] because it shares the same row as [0,0].
Stone [0,0] cannot be removed since it does not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.

Constraints:
<pre>
1 <= stones.length <= 1000
0 <= xi, yi <= 104
No two stones are at the same coordinate point.
