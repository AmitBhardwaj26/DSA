<h3>Medium</h3>
<hr>
<div><p>
 Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
<strong>Output:</strong> [8,6,2,4]
</pre>
<pre>
Explanation: At the beginning, the array is [1,2,3,4].
After adding 1 to nums[0], the array is [2,2,3,4], and the sum of even values is 2 + 2 + 4 = 8.
After adding -3 to nums[1], the array is [2,-1,3,4], and the sum of even values is 2 + 4 = 6.
After adding -4 to nums[0], the array is [-2,-1,3,4], and the sum of even values is -2 + 4 = 2.
After adding 2 to nums[3], the array is [-2,-1,3,6], and the sum of even values is -2 + 6 = 4.
  </pre>
  
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1], queries = [[4,0]]
Output: [0]
 

Constraints:
<pre>
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
1 <= queries.length <= 104
-104 <= vali <= 104
0 <= indexi < nums.length
