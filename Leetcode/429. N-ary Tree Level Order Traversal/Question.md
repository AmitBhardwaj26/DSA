<h3>Easy</h3>
<hr>
<div><p>
  Given an n-ary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
<strong>Output:</strong> [[1],[3,2,4],[5,6]]
</pre>



Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
Output: [[1],[2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9,10],[11,12,13],[14]]
 

Constraints:

The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to 1000
The total number of nodes is between [0, 104]
