<h3>Medium</h3>
<hr>
<div><p>
You want to schedule a list of jobs in d days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the ith job, you have to finish all the jobs j where 0 <= j < i).

You have to finish at least one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the d days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done on that day.

You are given an integer array jobDifficulty and an integer d. The difficulty of the ith job is jobDifficulty[i].
Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return -1.
  </p>


<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>   jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2
<strong>Output:</strong>7
</pre>
<pre>
First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6.
Second day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.
The difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7
  </pre>

 

Constraints:
<pre>
1 <= jobDifficulty.length <= 300
0 <= jobDifficulty[i] <= 1000
1 <= d <= 10
