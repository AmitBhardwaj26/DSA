<div><p>
You are given an integer n, the number of nodes in a directed graph where the nodes are labeled from 0 to n - 1. Each edge is red or blue in this graph, and there could be self-edges and parallel edges.

You are given two arrays redEdges and blueEdges where:

redEdges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is a directed red edge from node ai to node bi in the graph, and
blueEdges[j] = [uj, vj] indicates that there is a directed blue edge from node uj to node vj in the graph.
Return an array answer of length n, where each answer[x] is the length of the shortest path from node 0 to node x such that the edge colors alternate along the path, or -1 if such a path does not exist.

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> n = 3, redEdges = [[0,1],[1,2]], blueEdges = []
<strong>Output:</strong> [0,1,-1]
</pre>

 

Constraints:
<pre>
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
1 <= queries.length <= 104
-104 <= vali <= 104
0 <= indexi < nums.length
