<h3>Medium</h3>
<hr>
<div><p>
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n.

The average difference of the index i is the absolute difference between the average of the first i + 1 elements of nums and the average of the last n - i - 1 elements. Both averages should be rounded down to the nearest integer.

Return the index with the minimum average difference. If there are multiple such indices, return the smallest one.
  Note:

The absolute difference of two numbers is the absolute value of their difference.
The average of n elements is the sum of the n elements divided (integer division) by n.
The average of 0 elements is considered to be 0.

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>   nums = [2,5,3,9,5,3]
<strong>Output:</strong>  3
</pre>
<pre>
Explanation: At the beginning, the array is [1,2,3,4].
After adding 1 to nums[0], the array is [2,2,3,4], and the sum of even values is 2 + 2 + 4 = 8.
After adding -3 to nums[1], the array is [2,-1,3,4], and the sum of even values is 2 + 4 = 6.
After adding -4 to nums[0], the array is [-2,-1,3,4], and the sum of even values is -2 + 4 = 2.
After adding 2 to nums[3], the array is [-2,-1,3,6], and the sum of even values is -2 + 6 = 4.
  </pre>
  
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1], queries = [[4,0]]
Output: [0]
 

Constraints:
<pre>
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
1 <= queries.length <= 104
-104 <= vali <= 104
0 <= indexi < nums.length
