<h3>Medium</h3>
<hr>
<div><p>
There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1 and all the rooms are locked except for room 0. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.

When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.

Given an array rooms where rooms[i] is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room i, return true if you can visit all the rooms, or false otherwise.

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>   nums = [1,2,3,4], queries = [[1,0],[-3,1],[-4,0],[2,3]]
<strong>Output:</strong> [8,6,2,4]
</pre>
<pre>
Explanation: At the beginning, the array is [1,2,3,4].
After adding 1 to nums[0], the array is [2,2,3,4], and the sum of even values is 2 + 2 + 4 = 8.
After adding -3 to nums[1], the array is [2,-1,3,4], and the sum of even values is 2 + 4 = 6.
After adding -4 to nums[0], the array is [-2,-1,3,4], and the sum of even values is -2 + 4 = 2.
After adding 2 to nums[3], the array is [-2,-1,3,6], and the sum of even values is -2 + 6 = 4.
  </pre>
  
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1], queries = [[4,0]]
Output: [0]
 

Constraints:
<pre>
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
1 <= queries.length <= 104
-104 <= vali <= 104
0 <= indexi < nums.length
