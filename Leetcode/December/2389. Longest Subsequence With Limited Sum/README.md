<h3>Easy</h3>
<hr>
<div><p>
You are given an integer array nums of length n, and an integer array queries of length m.

Return an array answer of length m where answer[i] is the maximum size of a subsequence that you can take from nums such that the sum of its elements is less than or equal to queries[i].

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>   nums = [4,5,2,1], queries = [3,10,21]
<strong>Output:</strong> [8,6,2,4]
</pre>
<pre>
Explanation: At the beginning, the array is [1,2,3,4].
After adding 1 to nums[0], the array is [2,2,3,4], and the sum of even values is 2 + 2 + 4 = 8.
After adding -3 to nums[1], the array is [2,-1,3,4], and the sum of even values is 2 + 4 = 6.
After adding -4 to nums[0], the array is [-2,-1,3,4], and the sum of even values is -2 + 4 = 2.
After adding 2 to nums[3], the array is [-2,-1,3,6], and the sum of even values is -2 + 6 = 4.
  </pre>
  
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1], queries = [[4,0]]
Output: [0]
 

Constraints:
<pre>
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
1 <= queries.length <= 104
-104 <= vali <= 104
0 <= indexi < nums.length
