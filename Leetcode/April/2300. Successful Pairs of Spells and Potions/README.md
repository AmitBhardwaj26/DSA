<h3>Medium</h3>
<hr>
<div><p>
 You are given two positive integer arrays spells and potions, of length n and m respectively, where spells[i] represents the strength of the ith spell and potions[j] represents the strength of the jth potion.

You are also given an integer success. A spell and potion pair is considered successful if the product of their strengths is at least success.

Return an integer array pairs of length n where pairs[i] is the number of potions that will form a successful pair with the ith spell.

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>  spells = [5,1,3], potions = [1,2,3,4,5], success = 7
<strong>Output:</strong> [4,0,3]
</pre>
<pre>
Explanation: - 0th spell: 5 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [5,10,15,20,25]. 4 pairs are successful.
- 1st spell: 1 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [1,2,3,4,5]. 0 pairs are successful.
- 2nd spell: 3 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [3,6,9,12,15]. 3 pairs are successful.
Thus, [4,0,3] is returned.
  </pre>
 

Constraints:
<pre>
n == spells.length
m == potions.length
1 <= n, m <= 105
1 <= spells[i], potions[i] <= 105
1 <= success <= 1010
</pre>

            int left = 0;
            int right = m - 1;

            pairs[i] = m - left;
        }
        return pairs;
